In the third stage, we create a high-quality dialogue dataset for instruction tuning, which aligns VTimeLLM with human intent and also enables more precise video temporal understanding."

Therefore, LLM 1 and LLM 2 need to be delivered from another edge server. In this framework, to reduce communication overhead and latency, only the specific LLM parameter blocks need to be transmitted since the shared backbone/parameter blocks are already cached on the associated edge server. The entire LLM can be assembled before downloading, or on edge devices once all the needed parameter blocks have been received. To further reduce delivery latency, parameter-sharing LLM delivery can be combined with various compression techniques, where the compression ratio can be determined by jointly considering model performance and channel/backhaul conditions."

We plot the total effect of each downstream component when only the path between the sender head and that component is patched into the model. We find that both $a,b$ and mixed heads write primarily to MLPs. Similarly, when viewing an $a+b$ head (L24H10) and mixed head (L18H10) as receivers, we see that that the $a+b$ head is primarily dependent on the output from preceding MLPs. While that is true for the mixed head as well, we see that the mixed head also takes input from other $a,b$ heads, implying that it could have some role in creating the $a+b$ helix."
